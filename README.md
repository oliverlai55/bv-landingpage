#Oliver Lai Code Challenge

## Notes:
1. Styling for the progress bar is integrated in the main style.css file starting on line 5
2. The JS function is in js/script.js
3. Seemed like there were quite a few commented out section in index.html and some in style.css, I didn't touch those because I didn't want to delete anything you guys already had.
4. The instructions for the progress bar was to run slowest the 1st 1/3 of the time, then faster the 2nd 1/3, and fastest the last 1/3.  My animation fits that criteria.  However, I didn't make the effects dramatic because I wanted a smoother transition between each speed.  I wanted to point that out because it's probably not noticeable unless you look at the codes.  The CSS animation is in style.css line 59.

Thanks and I'd be happy to elaborate on any part of the challenge.  Hope to hear from you guys soon!
